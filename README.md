# JABARA
Just A Basic ARCore Application in Kotlin.

A Basic ARCore & Sceneform application for **android** written in **Kotlin** based on the [Sceneform Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/sceneform-intro/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) in Java.

## This Project Covers
1. ARCore Plane Detection
2. Adding AR Objects to the Scene
(adding AR Objects to the app through the sceneform plugin can be found at the codelab)
3. Animation on AR Objects
4. Capture Image in ARCore 
(trust me, capturing image from an ARCore app isn't straigh forward as we thought)
5. Save the captured image to Persistent Storage

AR is the future.
